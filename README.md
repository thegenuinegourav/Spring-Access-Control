It currently has three users (user, admin, db). All of them have different access control which renders the html thymeleaf template according to the user.  
Here,  
"user" user can access only user welcome page.  
"admin" user can access user welcome page & admin page both.  
"db" user can access the all the pages (user welcome page, admin page & dba page).
